Write a function that can take in a tree node and return true or false if it's a BST or not.</h3>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>   <img src=\"https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/bst-vs-not-bst.jpg\" alt=\"Image from programiz \"></p>\n<pre><code>Image from https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/bst-vs-not-bst.jpg\n</code></pre>\n<p>The left tree above is a BST but one on the right is not because the 2 is not bigger then 3. (Remember left side of the tree node contains values that are smaller, while the right side contain larger or equal values)</p>\n<p>Assume your class (if your working with Java) looks like this. You can choose to add other variables to the class:</p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<pre><code>static class BST {\n    public int value;\n    public BST left;\n    public BST right;\n\n    public BST(int value) {\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Validate BST","answer":"validateBSTAnswer","date":"May 14th, 2020"}}}},"pageContext":{"relativePath":"questions/validataBST.md"}}}
