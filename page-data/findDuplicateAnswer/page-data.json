But that uses O(n) space and the question states that we shouldn't be using any more then constant space</p>\n<p>The other solution that comes to mind is to sort the array and then run through it to find numbers that are the same as the previous numbers.</p>\n<p>That would be at O(nLogN), we can do better</p>\n<p>How can we solve this in linear time without using any other data structure?</p>\n<p>What if as we went along and see a number we went to that number's corresponding index and changed it to a negative number?</p>\n<p>That way we would know that we've seen that number before.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>  1, 6, 5, 2, 3, 3, 2\n\n  We start by visting 1's corresponding index which is 1 -1 = 0 and setting it to -1\n\n  So now it's\n\n  -1, 6, 5, 2, 3, 3, 2\n\n  Move to the next index and the number at that index is 6, so we go to 6-1 and set that index to negative\n\n  -1, 6, 5, 2, 3, -2\n\n  Anytime we run into a negative value we know that number was visited before therefore it's a duplicate.\n</code></pre>\n<p>  Here's what that code looks like:</p>\n  <div align=\"left\">\n<pre><code>public static void hasDuplicates(int[] arrA) {\n\n      for (int i = 0; i &#x3C; arrA.length; i++) {\n          //check if element is negative, if yes the we have found the duplicate\n          if (arrA[Math.abs(arrA[i])-1] &#x3C; 0) {\n              System.out.println(\"Array has duplicates : \" + (Math.abs(arrA[i])));\n          } else {\n              arrA[Math.abs(arrA[i])-1] = arrA[Math.abs(arrA[i])-1] * -1;\n          }\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n<p>  Hope you enjoyed that question! See you on the next one!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Find Duplicate Answer","question":"findDuplicate","date":"May 20th, 2020"}}}},"pageContext":{"relativePath":"answers/findDuplicateAnswer.md"}}}
