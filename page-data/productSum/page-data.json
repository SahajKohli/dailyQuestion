I wanted to start off the day with a question I've seen over and over again</p>\n<p>Write a function that takes in an \"special\" array and returns its product sum. A \"special\" array is a non=empty array that contains either integers or other \"special\" arrays.\nThe product sum of a \"special\" array is the sum of its element, where \"special\" array inside it are summed themselves and then multiplied by their level of depth.</p>\n<p>For example the product sum of [x, y] is [x+y]: the product sum of [x, [y, z]] is x + 2y + 2z.a</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>Array: [5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 0], 4]]\n\nAnswer: 12\n</code></pre>\n<p>The method signature looks like this:</p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<pre><code>public static int productSum(List&#x3C;Object> array) {\n    return productSumRec(array, 1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Product Sum","answer":"productSumAnswer","date":"May 19th, 2020"}}}},"pageContext":{"relativePath":"questions/productSum.md"}}}
