Then we can go through with the second string and delete the elements from the first string.</p>\n<p>We know that we can change the char if that char does not exist in the map anymore, this is because the char is now extra.</p>\n<p>Take a look here:</p>\n<p>For the first example, we have:</p>\n<pre><code>Input: s = \"bab\", t = \"aba\"\nOutput: 1\n\nMap[\nb 2\na 1\n]\n\nNow if we go through the second string, we can delete chars as we do:\n\nStep 1:\na  b  a\n^\ndelete a\n\nMap[\nb 2\n]\n\nStep 2:\na  b  a\n   ^\ndelete b\n\nMap[\nb 1\n]\n\nStep 2:\na  b  a\n      ^\ndelete a\n\nMap[\nb 1\n]\n\nThere's no a left in the array so we increment a counter\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's pretty much all we have to do here!</p>\n<p>Here's the code:</p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<pre><code>public int minSteps(String s, String t){\n\n    HashMap&#x3C;Character, Integer> mappedString = new HashMap&#x3C;>();\n\n    for(int i =0; i &#x3C; s.length(); i++){\n        Character currChar = s.charAt(i);\n        if(mappedString.containsKey(currChar)){\n            mappedString.put(currChar, mappedString.get(currChar) +1);\n        } else{\n            mappedString.put(currChar, 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    int count = 0;\n    for(int p =0; p &#x3C; t.length(); p++){\n        Character currChar = t.charAt(p);\n        if(mappedString.containsKey(currChar)){\n            if(mappedString.get(currChar) == 1){\n                mappedString.remove(currChar);\n            } else{\n                mappedString.put(currChar, mappedString.get(currChar) - 1);\n            }\n        } else{\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>This was a fun problem to work on, hopefully you enjoyed it as well.
