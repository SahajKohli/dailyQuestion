This generally speaks to a pattern that can be solved with recursion.</p>\n<p>We can start by seeing how we would deal with a regular list that only has number. This sub problem is easy enough to solve, we just sum up the numbers in the array by iterating over them.</p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<pre><code>sum += (int) array.get(i);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>That's easy enough, now we need to realize that anything inside of the array needs to mutiplied by a mutiplier that increases as we go into more arrays. A array with 3 arrays inside of it is going to have the multipliers of 1, 2, 3 (increasing as we go into arrays).</p>\n<p>Now for the recursive part, we need to check is the index we are on is a instance of a arraylist and then increase the multiplier. Then we can recurse on that array to grab the sum of the things inside.</p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<pre><code>if(array.get(i) instanceof ArrayList){\n    ArrayList&#x3C;Object> ls = (ArrayList&#x3C;Object>) array.get(i);\n    sum += productSumRec(ls, multiplier +1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Now we just put it all together:</p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<pre><code>public static int productSum(List&#x3C;Object> array) {\n    return productSumRec(array, 1);\n}\n\npublic static int productSumRec(List&#x3C;Object> array, int multiplier){\n    int sum = 0;\n    for(int i = 0; i &#x3C; array.size(); i++ ){\n        if(array.get(i) instanceof ArrayList){\n            ArrayList&#x3C;Object> ls = (ArrayList&#x3C;Object>) array.get(i);\n            sum += productSumRec(ls, multiplier +1);\n        } else{\n            sum += (int) array.get(i);\n        }\n    }\n    return multiplier * sum;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Product Sum Answer","question":"productSum","date":"May 19th, 2020"}}}},"pageContext":{"relativePath":"answers/productSumAnswer.md"}}}
