Welcome back to another question!

You are given two strings , s and t and you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

You should try to return minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of a.

An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with different (of the same ordering).anagram

Here are some examples:

Example 1:

    Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.

Example 2:

    Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.

Example 3:

    Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams.

Example 4:

    Input: s = "xxyyzz", t = "xxyyzz"
    Output: 0

Example 5:

    Input: s = "friend", t = "family"
    Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 50000
s.length == t.length
s and t contain lower-case English letters only.

Here's the method signature:

<div align= "left">

    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {

    }

<div>
If you think you have the answer, try to code it out and come back when you think you've figured it out.anagram

You got this!
